# Printing Marketplace Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a country-specific three-sided marketplace connecting students/businesses, print shops, and content creators
- Achieve same-day local fulfillment as key differentiator over online printing services (Vistaprint)
- Enable content creators to monetize educational materials through print-on-demand revenue sharing
- Establish #1 position in target country's educational printing market within 24 months
- Reach $1M ARR within 18 months through 15-20% platform commission
- Build network density of 50+ print shop partnerships in initial city within 12 months
- Acquire 10,000 active customers and 500 content creators within 24 months

### Background Context

The printing ecosystem is fragmented with students and businesses struggling with slow online printing delivery (3-5 days), content creators lacking physical distribution channels, and local print shops needing better customer acquisition. Our platform addresses this by combining the speed of local fulfillment with the convenience of digital ordering and creator monetization.

The timing is optimal: post-pandemic acceleration of digital adoption combined with return to physical learning materials creates a competitive window where no dominant player serves all three user segments effectively. Country-specific approach creates defensible competitive moats through local educational systems, cultural preferences, and regulatory compliance.

Modern typography optimized for mobile readability, intuitive iconography for quick recognition, and color palette that works across cultural preferences in target country. Emphasis on trust indicators (ratings, certifications, security badges) to build confidence in local business transactions.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Web Responsive platform optimized for mobile devices first, with desktop functionality for print shop management and creator content workflows. Native mobile apps planned for Phase 2 based on user adoption and engagement metrics.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision**: Single Next.js application with clear component/page/api separation  
**Rationale**: Next.js App Router provides excellent organization for full-stack applications. Single repository simplifies deployment and development workflow while maintaining clear separation between frontend components, API routes, and database models.

### Service Architecture

**Decision**: Next.js Full-Stack Application with API Routes and MongoDB microservices pattern  
**Rationale**: Next.js API routes provide serverless-ready backend functionality perfect for MVP development speed. MongoDB's document structure naturally fits the multi-role user system and flexible content metadata requirements. Serverless architecture scales automatically and reduces operational complexity.

**Core API Route Structure**:
- `/api/auth/*` - NextAuth.js authentication endpoints
- `/api/users/*` - User management and profile operations
- `/api/content/*` - Content upload, management, and discovery
- `/api/orders/*` - Order creation, tracking, and fulfillment
- `/api/payments/*` - Payment processing and revenue splitting
- `/api/admin/*` - Platform administration and analytics
- `/api/monitoring/*` - Health checks and performance metrics
- `/api/support/*` - Customer support and dispute resolution

### Testing Requirements

**Decision**: Unit + Integration testing with Playwright for E2E and Jest for API routes  
**Rationale**: Next.js ecosystem provides excellent testing tools. Critical payment flows and multi-user interactions require comprehensive testing. Playwright handles the complex multi-role user journeys while Jest covers API route business logic.

**Security & Compliance**:
- NextAuth.js built-in security features (CSRF, session management, OAuth flows)
- MongoDB field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Cloudflare security features (DDoS protection, Web Application Firewall)
- File upload validation and virus scanning through Cloudflare Workers
- Role-based access control with granular permissions system
- Input validation using Zod schemas across all API endpoints
- Security headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
- Comprehensive audit logging for all user actions

**Scalability Considerations**:
- Vercel's automatic scaling and edge network optimization
- MongoDB Atlas auto-scaling and global clusters for multi-country expansion
- Cloudflare R2's global distribution for fast file access
- Next.js API routes scale automatically with serverless architecture

## MVP Validation Framework

### MVP Success Metrics

**Primary Success Indicators (Must Achieve):**
- **User Acquisition**: 100+ registered users across all three roles (50 customers, 30 creators, 20 print shops) within first 3 months
- **Transaction Volume**: 200+ completed orders with $10,000+ GMV within first 6 months
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.0+ average rating across all user segments
- **Platform Functionality**: 95%+ successful order completion rate (from submission to fulfillment)
- **Technical Performance**: 99%+ uptime and <2 second average load times

**Secondary Success Indicators (Desired):**

- **Network Effects**: 20%+ of orders come from creator content (vs. customer-uploaded files)
- **Print Shop Engagement**: Average print shop processes 10+ orders per month
- **Revenue Generation**: Platform achieves $500+ monthly recurring revenue

### Learning Goals

**Critical Questions to Answer:**
1. **Market Demand**: Do students actually pay premium for same-day printing convenience?
2. **Unit Economics**: Can we maintain 15-20% take rate while keeping all parties profitable?
3. **Network Effects**: Does multi-sided marketplace create sustainable competitive advantages?
4. **Operational Complexity**: Can we manage quality control across multiple print shops effectively?
5. **Geographic Scalability**: Does the local fulfillment model work in different city environments?

### User Feedback Collection

**Continuous Feedback Mechanisms:**
- **In-App Surveys**: Post-order completion surveys (Net Promoter Score + qualitative feedback)
- **User Interviews**: Monthly 30-minute interviews with 5 users from each segment
- **Analytics Tracking**: User behavior analysis (drop-off points, feature usage, completion rates)
- **Support Ticket Analysis**: Common issues and pain points identification
- **Print Shop Partner Feedback**: Weekly check-ins during first 3 months

### MVP to Full Product Criteria

**Proceed to Phase 2 When:**
- All primary success metrics achieved consistently for 2+ months
