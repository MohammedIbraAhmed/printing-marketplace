2. **Unused Imports**: Some components have unused import statements
   - **Impact**: Minimal - slightly larger bundle size
   - **Recommendation**: Clean up unused imports in next sprint

3. **Import Warnings**: Some API routes had incorrect imports (fixed during testing)
   - **Impact**: None - fixed during QA process
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### 🚀 Recommended Enhancements
1. **Mobile Table Optimization**: Add horizontal scrolling for admin tables on mobile
2. **Email Library**: Replace email utilities with type-safe alternatives
