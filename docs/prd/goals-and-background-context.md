# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a country-specific three-sided marketplace connecting students/businesses, print shops, and content creators
- Achieve same-day local fulfillment as key differentiator over online printing services (Vistaprint)
- Enable content creators to monetize educational materials through print-on-demand revenue sharing
- Establish #1 position in target country's educational printing market within 24 months
- Reach $1M ARR within 18 months through 15-20% platform commission
- Build network density of 50+ print shop partnerships in initial city within 12 months
- Acquire 10,000 active customers and 500 content creators within 24 months

## Background Context

The printing ecosystem is fragmented with students and businesses struggling with slow online printing delivery (3-5 days), content creators lacking physical distribution channels, and local print shops needing better customer acquisition. Our platform addresses this by combining the speed of local fulfillment with the convenience of digital ordering and creator monetization.

The timing is optimal: post-pandemic acceleration of digital adoption combined with return to physical learning materials creates a competitive window where no dominant player serves all three user segments effectively. Country-specific approach creates defensible competitive moats through local educational systems, cultural preferences, and regulatory compliance.
