# MVP Validation Framework

## MVP Success Metrics

**Primary Success Indicators (Must Achieve):**
- **User Acquisition**: 100+ registered users across all three roles (50 customers, 30 creators, 20 print shops) within first 3 months
- **Transaction Volume**: 200+ completed orders with $10,000+ GMV within first 6 months
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.0+ average rating across all user segments
- **Platform Functionality**: 95%+ successful order completion rate (from submission to fulfillment)
- **Technical Performance**: 99%+ uptime and <2 second average load times

**Secondary Success Indicators (Desired):**
- **Retention**: 30%+ of customers place repeat orders within 60 days
- **Network Effects**: 20%+ of orders come from creator content (vs. customer-uploaded files)
- **Print Shop Engagement**: Average print shop processes 10+ orders per month
- **Revenue Generation**: Platform achieves $500+ monthly recurring revenue

## Learning Goals

**Critical Questions to Answer:**
1. **Market Demand**: Do students actually pay premium for same-day printing convenience?
2. **Unit Economics**: Can we maintain 15-20% take rate while keeping all parties profitable?
3. **Network Effects**: Does multi-sided marketplace create sustainable competitive advantages?
4. **Operational Complexity**: Can we manage quality control across multiple print shops effectively?
5. **Geographic Scalability**: Does the local fulfillment model work in different city environments?

## User Feedback Collection

**Continuous Feedback Mechanisms:**
- **In-App Surveys**: Post-order completion surveys (Net Promoter Score + qualitative feedback)
- **User Interviews**: Monthly 30-minute interviews with 5 users from each segment
- **Analytics Tracking**: User behavior analysis (drop-off points, feature usage, completion rates)
- **Support Ticket Analysis**: Common issues and pain points identification
- **Print Shop Partner Feedback**: Weekly check-ins during first 3 months

## MVP to Full Product Criteria

**Proceed to Phase 2 When:**
- All primary success metrics achieved consistently for 2+ months
- Unit economics proven sustainable (positive contribution margin per order)
- Clear evidence of product-market fit (organic growth, word-of-mouth referrals)
- Operational processes scalable to 2+ additional cities
- Technical architecture handling target load without major issues

**Pivot Considerations:**
- If student demand insufficient, pivot to small business focus
- If local fulfillment fails, consider hybrid online/local model
- If three-sided complexity too high, focus on two-sided marketplace (customers + print shops)

## Validation Timeline

**Month 1-2**: Infrastructure validation (technical performance, basic user flows)
**Month 3-4**: Market validation (user acquisition, initial transactions)
**Month 5-6**: Business model validation (unit economics, retention, satisfaction)
**Month 6+**: Scale validation (network effects, operational efficiency)
