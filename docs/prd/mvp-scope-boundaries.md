## Rationale for Exclusions

**Focus on Core Value Proposition**: Every excluded feature ensures we focus on the essential three-sided marketplace functionality
**Resource Constraints**: Small founding team needs to deliver MVP within 20-week timeline
**Learning Priority**: Need to validate core assumptions before adding complexity
**Technical Complexity**: Advanced features require significant development time that could delay market validation
**Market Validation**: Must prove basic model works before investing in advanced features
